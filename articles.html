            <h2 data-i18n="al">Al-Safir hair transplantation technique</h2>
            <p data-i18n="is">The Sapphire hair transplantation technique is a relatively modern technique that uses the Sapphire pen to open the channels in which the follicles are transplanted. This technology has many advantages compared to other traditional techniques, such as:

                Higher precision: The Sapphire gemstone pen allows finer-looking channels to be opened, resulting in a more natural appearance of the transplanted hair.
                Less stress on tissue: The Sapphire Pen causes less stress to tissue than metal blades, resulting in a shorter recovery period and less pain.
                LESS RISK OF BLEEDING: The Ambassador pen tends to bleed less than metal blades, reducing the risk of infection.
                Al-Safir hair transplantation technique is very similar to FUE hair transplantation technique, where hair follicles are extracted from the donor area one by one using fine needles. However, the Sapphire technique uses the Sapphire pen to open channels in the recipient area, rather than using metal blades.
                
                The hair transplantation process using the Sapphire technique includes the following steps:
                
                The surgeon administers local anesthesia to the scalp area.
                The surgeon uses fine needles to extract hair follicles from the donor area.
                The surgeon opens fine channels in the recipient area using the Sapphire pen.
                The surgeon implants hair follicles into the open channels.
                The hair transplantation process using the Sapphire technique usually takes between 4 to 8 hours, depending on the size of the area being transplanted.
                
                The Sapphire hair transplantation technique has many advantages over other traditional techniques, making it a good choice for people looking for natural results and a shorter recovery period..</p>

            <h2 data-i18n="hair">Hair transplantation using DHI technology</h2>
            <p data-i18n="dhi">DHI hair transplantation is a relatively new technique that uses a Choi Implanter Pen to implant hair follicles directly into the recipient area. This technology has many advantages compared to other traditional techniques, such as:

                Higher precision: The Choi pen allows hair follicles to be transplanted with greater precision, resulting in a more natural appearance of the transplanted hair.
                Greater speed: The surgeon can transplant more hair follicles in less time using the Choi pen, reducing the duration of the procedure.
                Less pain: The Choi Pen causes less pain than traditional techniques, making the procedure more comfortable for the patient.
                DHI hair transplantation is very similar to FUE hair transplantation, where hair follicles are extracted from the donor area one by one using fine needles. However, the DHI hair transplant technique uses a Choi pen to implant hair follicles into the recipient area, rather than using fine needles.
                
                The DHI hair transplant procedure includes the following steps:
                
                The surgeon administers local anesthesia to the scalp area.
                The surgeon uses fine needles to extract hair follicles from the donor area.
                The surgeon implants hair follicles in the recipient area using a Choi pen.
                The DHI hair transplant procedure usually takes between 4 to 8 hours, depending on the size of the area being transplanted.
                
                DHI hair transplantation has many advantages over other traditional techniques, making it a good option for people looking for natural results and a shorter recovery period.
                
                The difference between the DHI technique and the FUE technique
                
                DHI and FUE have many things in common, such as:
                
                Hair follicles are extracted from the donor area one by one using fine needles.
                Channels are opened in the recipient area using fine blades or needles.
                Hair follicles are transplanted into the open channels.
                However, there are some key differences between the two technologies, such as:
                
                Follicle transplantation method: In the DHI technique, hair follicles are transplanted directly into the recipient area using a Choi pen. In the FUE technique, hair follicles are placed into open channels using fine needles.
                Precision of transplantation: The DHI technique has higher precision than the FUE technique, resulting in a more natural appearance of the transplanted hair.
                Speed of the procedure: The surgeon can transplant more hair follicles in less<span data-i18n="span"> time using the DHI technique, which reduces the duration of the operation.
                Pain: DHI causes less pain than FUE, making the procedure more comfortable for the patient.
                Suitable people for DHI hair transplantation
                
                DHI hair transplantation can be a good option for people with:
                
                Hereditary baldness
                Alopecia
                Hair loss due to surgery or chemotherapy</span></p>
